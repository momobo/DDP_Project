## Instructions
This is a simple application to model the consume in km/l of an ipotetic car.
Just plug in in the inputs:
1. The weight in kg of the car.
2. The type of transmission (automatic or manual)
3. The time in sec to cover a quarter of mile (approx 400 m)

The model will tell you the consume of the car.
"Elevator Pitch" slides could be found at http://momobo.github.io/DDP_Project

## Note
The model is based to a simple linear model. 
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance 
for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). Not so new, I know.
